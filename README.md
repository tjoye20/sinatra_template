# Sinatra template

This repository is a template to quickly get started building Sinatra apps.

Notable packages included: dotenv gem (to store data in your local environment), and Semantic UI CDN web framework. Feel free to configure

### Quickstart

Fork this repository into your Github profile, then clone it down to your local machine. Now, ```` bundle install ```` to install all the required gems. You'll use ```` bundle exec```` before all commands now, to make sure you're including the list of gems required every time you make changes to the program.

Ex.: To launch Sinatra, you use ```` bundle exec shotgun````. To enter your Rake commands, you enter ```` bundle exec rake db:create ````

Note: ````be```` is a stored alias for ````bundle exec````, so your commands can be entered as ````be shotgun````, or ```` be rake db:create````, etc.
